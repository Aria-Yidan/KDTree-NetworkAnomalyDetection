# KDTree-NetworkAnomalyDetection
KDD1999 data set, Network attack detection, ROC curve

Using the KDD1999 data set to construct the training data set and test data set, using KD tree to construct a multidimensional space for nearest neighbor search data structure, to judge whether a certain amount of data is abnormal and belongs to what type of attack. The system performance is evaluated using the ROC curve.
